// Chapter 5 Exercise 14 and 25 - Student Lineup.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.
//// Programmer: Brenna Meyer 
// Date: March 19th, 2025
// Requirements: A teacher has asked all her students to line up according to their first name.
//For example, in one class Amy will be at the front of the line, and Yolanda will be at the end.
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter the number of students in the class, then loops to read that many names.
// Once all the names have been read, it reports which student would be at the front of the line and
// which one would be at the end of the line.You may assume that no two students have the same name.
// Input Validation : Do not accept a number less than 1 or greater than 25 for the number of students.
